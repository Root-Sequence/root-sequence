# Repository coherence audit

**Document role:** Audit record and cleanup change log<br>
**Status:** Active record<br>
**Audit date:** 2026-09-17<br>
**Baseline:** `main` at `8b551209ea04d4ce5425d569565a2a9784fd463c`<br>

This audit covers the reader-facing Markdown, generated-site pages, directory indexes, navigation sources, and related publishing records in `Root-Sequence/root-sequence`.

It does not revise other repositories. Private or project-specific pages are named only when this repository needs to explain a boundary or route a reader to the canonical home.

## Architecture adopted

- [`README.md`](README.md) is the concise public front door.
- [`root_map.md`](root_map.md) is the canonical repository architecture and linking guide.
- [`ECOSYSTEM.md`](ECOSYSTEM.md) is the canonical organization-level project map.
- [`IDEA_TRAILS.md`](IDEA_TRAILS.md) explains recurring cross-project questions; [`IDEA_TRAIL_INDEX.md`](IDEA_TRAIL_INDEX.md) is generated from [`IDEA_TRAIL_GRAPH.yml`](IDEA_TRAIL_GRAPH.yml).
- Every content directory owns its local navigation through its `README.md`.
- Substantive pages keep one primary home. Historical summaries, project-specific transformations, migration pointers, generated pages, and validation records identify themselves instead of competing with that home.

The detailed canonical-page, linking, and status-label rules live in [`root_map.md`](root_map.md) so this audit does not become a second architecture specification.

## Coverage

The pass inspected:

- 156 Markdown files present at the baseline;
- the 11 pages defined in `site/content.json` and their generated output;
- repository, directory, Idea Trail, and website navigation;
- the machine-readable Idea Trail graph and generated browser;
- the public agent-contact files and SECI research indexes;
- local and cross-repository links;
- the two open draft pull requests that overlap adjacent website and research work.

The repository was reviewed by role and directory, not only by searching for broken URLs. Long research pages were checked for scope, status, placement, and discoverability; short and legacy pages were checked for missing context, duplication, source debt, and malformed navigation.

## Findings and resolutions

### Empty and misleading pages

Fifteen tracked Markdown files were empty at the baseline. One, `systems/adaptation/README.md`, now provides a real local index. The remaining empty files were retired; their intended topics remain recorded as planned directions in the appropriate directory README instead of appearing as finished pages.

### Broken and ambiguous links

Relative links were repaired in the root README, concepts, core, commons, zines, Collapse Memory, and futures material. Old personal-account repository URLs were replaced with current Root Sequence homes. Directory indexes now use actual links instead of filenames formatted as code.

The previously linked `noonenoticed.world` domain could not be verified through either a direct request or a browser request during the audit. Public pages now route to the maintained Ecosystem description and identify the canonical workspace as private instead of presenting an unavailable public site as current.

### Duplicated or unclear canonical homes

- The nearly identical curiosity and empathy pages now have distinct roles: `concepts/` owns the short definition, while `core/` explains the concept's role in the Root Sequence cycle.
- Root-level Liberated Intelligence and UCF pages are retained as historical Root Sequence overviews and point to their dedicated canonical repositories.
- The two SECI entry layers are explicitly separated: the parent page defines the research umbrella; the nested README operates the active program.
- Collapse Memory and Auryn material now identifies its speculative or fictional status and does not present itself as practical emergency guidance or current fiction canon.

### Missing local navigation

Concepts, core texts, commons fragments and zines, and systems subareas now link their developed pages. Empty application directories no longer masquerade as populated sections. Planned work is named without creating placeholder links.

### Status and evidence language

[`root_map.md`](root_map.md) separates document role, maturity, canonical scope, evidence status, and access. Pages touched in this cleanup use those meanings. Unsupported citation placeholders were converted into explicit evidence-work notes or removed from non-evidentiary manifestos rather than remaining as decorative footnotes.

### Generated website

The website remains an introductory projection, not a replacement for repository research or the Wiki. Its source, publication boundary, and validation records remain in `site/`. The cleanup checks generated navigation and rendered pages but does not approve or deploy a release.

`site/content.json` was also expanded from minified JSON into reviewable formatting. The formatting change is large in line count; the semantic changes are limited to the project list, related-project relationships, unavailable *No One Noticed* links, homepage framing, and this audit's changelog entry.

## Remaining work

This cleanup makes evidence debt visible; it does not invent sources or claim that every exploratory argument is established. Several older analysis, ideology, and futures pages still need source-by-source research review. That work should happen in bounded evidence passes and should preserve the distinction between observation, interpretation, metaphor, and normative claim.

Two draft pull requests remain separate by design:

- PR #6 develops the coherent-systems paper and should rebase or reconcile any shared navigation files before merge.
- PR #7 is an isolated website editorial/accessibility review and should be integrated into the canonical builder only after editorial approval.

Neither draft was merged into this audit branch, and neither was treated as current published state.

## Verification record

The final branch was checked for:

- zero empty Markdown files across the final 146-file set;
- local Markdown links, local heading fragments, inbound Markdown navigation, and at least one readable top-level heading per reader-facing Markdown page;
- all 95 distinct referenced GitHub repository or file destinations through the GitHub API;
- current generated Idea Trail output;
- all 17 website publication tests and a fresh preview build;
- all 11 generated-site routes at narrow and wide viewport sizes, including navigation, page details, heading presence, and horizontal-overflow checks;
- representative external destinations, with access-denied responses recorded as inconclusive rather than silently treated as success;
- changed-file scope, whitespace integrity, valid JSON, and a full diff review.

See the draft pull request for the exact command results, limitations, and any unresolved external-link behavior.
